# MTCP - Multiple testing & change-points

A package containing the Difference of Slopes (DOS) method for estimating the proportion of false null hypotheses in multiple testing. Vignettes include a simulation study that compares the proposed method to many other proportion estimators in the literature. The package also includes simulations examining the performance when the p-values are correlated and superuniform, as well as simulations examining adaptive FDR control.
